DAI CLI

  Dai 1.0 is a simple version of the diversely collateralized Dai.

  In this model there is one type of underlying collateral (called gems).
  The PETH token represents claims on the system's excess gems, and is the
  only admissible type of collateral. Gems can be converted to/from PETH.

  Any transfers of dai or PETH are done using the normal ERC20 interface;
  until settlement mode is triggered, dai users should only need ERC20.

  To conveniently perform ERC20 transfers, see the token(1) program
  available at <https://github.com/dapphub/token>.
